Pool automation and metering.

Still in development ... 

PH/ORP measuring based on the same cheap analog module:

For ORP you have to ca of first trimmer (clouse to BNC) and replace it with 30k Ohm resistor. Thats all.

Note: This module needs very stable voltage on his input. In case of you will use both module PH/ORP in same water, I am recomande to add to the front of your module galvanic separation, like NME0505SC.
