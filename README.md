Pool automation and metering.

Still in development ... 

PH/ORB messuring based on the same cheap analog module, this one:

Note: This module needs very stable voltage on his input. In case of you will use both module PH/ORP in same water, I am recomande to add to the front of your module galvanic separation, like NME0505SC.
